I have completed and tested all the way to stage7 as stated
in the project assignment. (100 points)


Termination of peers: For each input, each router should print
the average number of rounds the queue becomes empty before
finding a message.

What is the smallest value of num_Empty so that all messages get
propagated?



Testing:  queues should be empty at end

Status : I have completed my Stage 7 and other updates based on the logic given.In addition 
I tested whether queues are empty at the end and they are empty.
